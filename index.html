        <h3> YOU ALL HEARD ABOUT LAKHEY RIGHT?
        </h3>
        <h3> IF NOT THEN SIMPLY VISIT THE LINK BELOW </h3>
        <h4> So, In this website we will learn about lakhey history.</h4>
            <p>According to stories passed down through generations,
            majipa lakhey is supposed to have fallen in love with a girl from Majipa.
            So, the demon takes a form of a human and enters the city to see his beloved.
            Upon knowing the fact that the person is a Lakhey, the people capture the lakhey
            and present him to the king. The king makes a proposal to the demon that he will 
            grant him a place in the city if he vows to preserve the children from other demons 
            and participate in the annual Yanyaa Punhi Jatra (also called Indra Jatra). 
            The Lakhey agrees and is supposed to reside in Majipa ever since. </p>
