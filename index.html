                <h1> YOU ALL HEARD ABOUT LAKHEY RIGHT?
                </h1>
            <p> According to stories passed down through generations,
                majipa lakhey is supposed to have fallen in love with a girl
                from Majipa. So, the demon takes a form of a human and enters 
                the city to see his beloved.Upon knowing the fact that the person 
                is a Lakhey, the people capture the lakhey and present him to the king. 
                The king makes a proposal to the demon that he will grant him a place
                in the city if he vows to preserve the children from other demons 
                and participate in the annual Yanyaa Punhi Jatra (also called Indra Jatra). 
                The Lakhey agrees and is supposed to reside in Majipa ever since</p> </div>
